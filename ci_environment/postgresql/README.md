Description
-----------

This cookbook is designed to install several versions of PostgreSQL for Continuous Integration purpose, and currently only supports Ubuntu 12.04 and 14.04 platforms.

The **default** recipe of this Chef cookbook will:

* Add PGDG apt repository
* Install a default PostgreSQL version from PGDG repository (e.g. 9.1)
* Install alternate PostgreSQL versions from PGDG repository (e.g. 9.2 and 9.3). Note that all PostgreSQL instances are configured to listen on the same tcp port. (optional)
* Create additional superusers in all available PostgreSQL instances (optional)
* Override `/etc/init.d/postgresql` script to ensure that only one instance is running at the same time
* Use RAMFS storage to reduce I/O impact (optional)
* Tune some `postgresql.conf` parameters for performance optimization in a CI context (e.g. disable `fsync` data safety) (optional)
* include **postgis** recipe to:
 * Add ubuntugis-stable PPA to backport libgdal1 (>= 1.9.0) on Ubuntu 12.04
 * Install the same PostGIS version from PGDG repository (e.g. 2.1) to all PostgreSQL instances (optional). Attention some combinations are not supported (e.g. PostGIS 2.1/PostgreSQL 8.4 or PostGIS 2.0/PostgreSQL 9.3)

If you look for a more *"standard"* installation (e.g. for a productive database server), the [Opscode Community Cookbook](http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/postgresql) and genuine [PostgreSQL Global Development Group (PGDG) packages](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Apt) may better fit your needs.
