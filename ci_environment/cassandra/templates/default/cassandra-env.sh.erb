# Override these to set the amount of memory to allocate to the JVM at
# start-up. For production use you almost certainly want to adjust
# this for your environment. MAX_HEAP_SIZE is the total amount of
# memory dedicated to the Java heap; HEAP_NEWSIZE refers to the size
# of the young generation. Both MAX_HEAP_SIZE and HEAP_NEWSIZE should
# be either set or not (if you set one, set the other).
#
# The main trade-off for the young generation is that the larger it
# is, the longer GC pause times will be. The shorter it is, the more
# expensive GC will be (usually).
#
# The example HEAP_NEWSIZE assumes a modern 8-core+ machine for decent pause
# times. If in doubt, and if you do not particularly want to tweak, go with
# 100 MB per physical CPU core.
