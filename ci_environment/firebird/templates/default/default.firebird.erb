# Firebird server is disabled by default.
# To enable run
#   `dpkg-reconfigure firebird2.5-FLAVOUR' as root
# replacing FLAVOUR witht he flavour of firebird server you use (super, classic
# or superclassic).
# This will also prompt you for a new SYSDBA password and is the recommended
# way for enabling/disabling the firebird server.
# 
# You could also just change the assignment below from 'no' to 'yes'
# and:
#   for -classic: run `update-inetd --enable firebird2.5-classic'
#   for -super: run `invoke--rc.d firebird2.5-super start'
#   for -superclassic: run `invoke-rc.d firebird2.5-superclassic start'
# If you enable the server this way, don't forget to change SYSDBA password
# (and possibly store it in /etc/firebird/2.5/SYSDBA.password)

# CAUTION: allowing two different servers access the same database
# simultaneously will inevitably lead to database corruption and data loss.

ENABLE_FIREBIRD_SERVER=yes
