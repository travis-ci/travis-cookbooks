# IMPORTANT: this recipe is only really needed by the Ruby on Rails test suite
#            that is very I/O demanding. It places MySQL'd data dir to a ramfs mount
#            and copies existing data dir there so that system catalogs are in place, then
#            restarts mysqld once again. Copying & restart also will happen once again on boot.
#            This whole sequence is indeed hacky and needs extra care. But c'est la vie,
#            ActiveRecord test suite runs x3 times faster with this recipe in place. MK.
#


# A detailed description of the madness:
# 1. Install MySQL as usual, using mysql::server.
# 2. Set up users, again, as part of mysql::server.
# 3. Mount /var/ramfs, copy mysql datadir there
# 4. Swap my.cnf with another version that uses /var/ramfs/mysql for datadir
# 5. Install a custom Upstart configuration file
# 6. Restart MySQL at the end of the Chef run
#
#

require "fileutils"

include_recipe "ramfs"

# next, install the packages, do pre-seeding, restart mysqld all from a regular
# ext3 mount.

include_recipe "mysql::server"

log "['mysql']['data_dir'] = #{node['mysql']['data_dir']}"
log "[:mysql][:data_dir] = #{node[:mysql][:data_dir]}"

# stop mysql before copying the files over

  action :stop
end

bash "cp -R #{node['mysql']['data_dir']} #{node[:ramfs][:dir]}/mysql" do
  code "cp -R #{node['mysql']['data_dir']} #{node[:ramfs][:dir]}/mysql && chown -R mysql:mysql #{node[:ramfs][:dir]}/mysql"

  # run this bash snippet only after mysql-install-privileges has run, but not earlier
  subscribes :run, resources(:execute => "mysql-install-privileges"), :immediately
end

# Now install a custom my.cnf that will use a ramfs directory for datadir.

  # yes, notify about restart at the end of Chef run and NOT immediately
  notifies :restart, resources(:service => "mysql"), :delayed
end


# Tweak Upstart job script to copy /var/lib/mysql => /var/ramfs/mysql before
# starting mysqld up.
