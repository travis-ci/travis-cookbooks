* Download and install/upgrade Android SDK (not ADT)
* Update SDK dependencies to install *some* Android platforms (`--filter` list can be customized in cookbook attributes)
* Define a default `ANDROID_HOME` environment variable (via `/etc/profile.d/...` mechanism)
* Add `ANDROID_HOME/tools` and `ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools` to default `PATH` environment variable (via `/etc/profile.d/...` mechanism)

Requirements
------------

* Depends on **opscode/ark** and **opscode/java** cookbooks
* This cookbook currently supports Ubuntu 12.04+, but more Linux distributions are welcome (depending on community interests)

Attributes

Quality Assurance
-----------------

### Continous Integration

This Cookbook is being _tasted_ by Travis CI: [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/gildegoma/chef-android-sdk.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/gildegoma/chef-android-sdk)

Automated validations are following:
  * Static Analysis of Ruby code with [tailor](https://github.com/turboladen/tailor#readme) lint tool
  * Static Analysis of Chef Cookbooks with [foodcritic](http://acrmp.github.com/foodcritic/) lint tool
  * `knife cookbook test` in a very basic sandbox
  * _PENDING:_ Expectations described with RSpec examples with [ChefSpec](https://github.com/acrmp/chefspec)
  * _PENDING:_ [ServerSpec](http://serverspec.org/) integration testing
  * _PENDING:_ Run true chef (matrix) on travis VM!

### Development and Testing

During development, this cookbook is locally tested in following environments:
 * Development with *recent* versions of Chef-Solo and Ubuntu (with great help of Berkshelf, Vagrant and Virtualbox and other tools provided by the Chef community).
