{"name":"compat_resource","version":"12.14.0","description":"Brings the modern custom resource syntax to earlier Chef 12 releases prior to 12.5","long_description":"# compat_resource cookbook\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/chef-cookbooks/compat_resource.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/chef-cookbooks/compat_resource)\n[![Cookbook Version](https://img.shields.io/cookbook/v/compat_resource.svg)](https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/compat_resource)\n\n\nThis cookbook brings the custom resource syntax from Chef 12.5 to earlier Chef 12.X releases.\n\n## Converting cookbooks from the old resource model to the new\n\n### Boilerplate\n\n1. Depend on compat_resource\n   - Descend resources from ChefCompat::Resource\n   - Set resource_name in the class instead of the constructor\n2. Convert Attributes to Properties\n   - Rename attribute -> property\n   - Move set_or_return -> property\n   - Take kind_of/equal_to/regexes and make them types\n   - Use true/false/nil instead of TrueClass/FalseClass/NilClass\n   - Remove default: nil (it's the default)\n3. Convert Top-Level Providers to Actions\n   - Create any resources that don't already exist (for example in\n     multi-provider cases) and descend from the base resource\n   - Remove allowed_actions / @actions\n   - @action -> default_action\n   - Move `provides` and `action :x` to the resource\n   - Remove use_inline_resources and def whyrun_safe?\n   - Move other methods to `action_class.class_eval do`\n\nNow you have everything in a resource, are using properties, and have gotten rid\nof a bunch of boilerplate. Of course, this is just getting it *moved*. Now you\ncan start to really use the new features. And if you're making resources for\nthe first time, congrats--you probably didn't have to do very much of this :)\n\n### Advanced Concepts\n\n1. Resource Inheritance\n2. Resources That Are Different On Each OS?\n3. Coercion: Handling User Input\n4. Lazy Defaults\n5. Using Load Current Resource\n6. Using Converge If Changed\n7. Defaults Are For Creation\n8. Shared types: using a type multiple places\n\n\n\nRequirements\n------------\n#### Platforms\n- All platforms supported by Chef\n\n#### Chef\n- Chef 12.0+\n\n#### Cookbooks\n- none\n\n\n## Usage\n\nTo use this cookbook, put `depends 'compat_resource'` in the metadata.rb of your cookbook. Once this is done, you can use all the new custom resource features to define resources. It Just Works.\n\nFor example, if you create resources/myresource.rb, myresource can use `property`, `load_current_value` and `action` (no need to create a provider). If you want to create Resource classes directly, extend from `ChefCompat::Resource` instead of `Chef::Resource`. Properties, current value loading, converge_if_changed, and resource_name will all function the same across versions.\n\n## Custom Resources?\n\nCurious about how to use custom resources?
